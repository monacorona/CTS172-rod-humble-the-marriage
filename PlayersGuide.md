Writing a Player’s Guide


Game Mechanics:
There is no clicking allowed, or the game will end abruptly.
When the mouse hovers above the blue or the pink square, the squares begin to move towards each other.
When the mouse hovers over the blue square, it reduces in size.
As time elapses, the pink square becomes more transparent.
When the squares “kiss” but don’t overlap, the blue square reduces in size and becomes more transparent, and the pink square becomes larger and more opaque. 
If either the pink or blue squares becomes totally transparent, or shrink to nothing, the game ends.
Whenever a pink or blue square touches a black circle, it shrinks.
When the blue square hits other elements (except for black) it increases in size rapidly and becomes less transparent.

Game Rules:
There is no clicking allowed, or the game will end abruptly.
In essence, there is a need for balance in the game. The player must make sure that the pink square does not fade from the marriage, and the blue square must make contacts with other elements so that it does not fade.
The player must navigate though the ebb and flow of the game, making sure that each square’s needs are met.

Humble’s Intent and the Meaning of the Game:

Humble’s game “The Marriage” is his interpretation and expression of “how a marriage feels”. The two squares symbolize a more ‘traditional’ marriage, the blue symbolizing the male and the pink symbolizing the female. Two important aspects of the marriage, ego and emotional investment determine the marriage’s success, and are represented as size and opacity. If a pink square fades, it symbolizes a decrease of emotional investment in the marriage. If a blue square decreases in size, it symbolizes a decrease in ego or “personality”. While the complete disappearance of the blue square will result in ending the game, having the blue square grow too large will restrict the pink square’s ability to move and interact with other elements, literally trapping it. For the marriage to be successful, the pink square must remain emotionally invested by interacting with, or “kissing” the blue square. The blue square must have the ability to interact with other elements “outside” of the marriage to prevent it from either fading or shrinking into nothing. Each square’s needs must be accounted for in order to make the marriage survive.

While this is the way Humble sees marriage, he realizes that people will extract a different meaning from the game that is relevant to their own experiences. The main point he hopes to get across is the “fragility” of marriage, as well as the need for balance in order for a marriage to survive.

Game Modifications:

I wanted to present a particular kind of relationship with very specific dynamics in my version of Humble’s game, and named it “The Affair”. In this version, I changed some of the colors to those traditionally considered more feminine, so that most of the circle elements represented the blue square’s extramarital female “relations” that would have a much more negative impact on the pink square. The blue square’s “ego” or size becomes larger every time it encounters a circle element, symbolizing a “player”. The only helpful circle element to the pink square is the black circle, symbolizing a meaningful friendship that helps the pink square increase it’s size, preventing it from shrinking off the page entirely. When an element or “potential affair” disappears from the page, the pink square’s size also slightly increases. However, hovering over either square during The Affair will cause both to shrink—this time the pink square shrinking more rapidly. This signifies the effect of humiliation on each square. While the blue square faces some humiliation, other male counterparts or “friends” (the cyan circles) will praise him for having numerous affairs with women, offsetting how rapidly it would shrink if otherwise. If both the blue and pink square kiss, both will slightly increase in size. Neither square benefits greatly from “kissing” as this game symbolizes a somewhat toxic relationship.

This is not meant as a generalization of male-female relationships that encounter infidelity, but it symbolizes some dynamics that couples may experience during an affair.
